#![forbid(clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks)]

//! The one shared Executor that Direct Execution, Cached Execution, and every Plugin Event
//! handler funnel through. No execution path reaches a Registered Function or consumes
//! Resource Budget outside this crate. For any execution that continues past its dispatching
//! call's return (every async = true Plugin handler), the spawned task is handed a live
//! budget-accounting handle, not a closed one.
//! The only crate that depends on hexput-enforce.
//!
//! Binds: AD-3, AD-6.
