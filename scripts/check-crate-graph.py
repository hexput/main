"""Assert the AD-enforcing edges of the workspace crate graph.

The Architecture Spine states several rules of the shape "only X may reach Y
directly". A crate boundary only enforces such a rule once some code actually
imports the crate: a forbidden edge present in a manifest but not yet used
compiles and lints clean. While a crate is still a stub, nothing imports its dependency, so an invalid edge
would surface much later, in an unrelated change, reading as pre-existing.

This script closes that gap by asserting the edges directly against the
resolved dependency graph from `cargo metadata`, so the Spine's rules fail CI
rather than a future code review.

Run: python3 scripts/check-crate-graph.py
